husband: This probability will be weakened only, not destroy=
=ed, by the intervention of an Adulterer. It may indeed be perfect-
ly destroyed by facts which prove the impossibility of a con.
jugal intercourse with the husband; such as absence or in=

in particular they must necessarily be known at the time to the
party most interested in the case, viz: the Husband: so that if
they are not brought to light at the very time, they are never
brought to light at all. But the fact of a suppositio partus
may be brought to light at any distance of time by the treach=
ery or repentance of persons privy to the imposture. The
former case is therefore is attended with much less mis-
-chief than the latter.
