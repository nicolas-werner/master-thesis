C.
Of Matrimonial Desertion.

It will be necessary to define what shall be deemed
Desertion, distinguishing it from the cases of lawful Absence,
and what steps shall be taken for giving Notice.

Let certain methods be established whereby the Husband
and the Wife may be enabled and obliged to correspond with
one another at stated intervals and let a failure on either part
for a certain time be deemed presumptive evidence of death or
desertion. Within the dominions of the state this might be managed
in the manner mentioned in the Book of Pauper-Polit.

As to Foreigners, upon their coming into the country,
let them be obliged to declare upon oath whether they are married
or single, and if single whether Bachelors or Spinsters, Widowers
or Widows. Of these declarations let Registers be kept of which
extracts to their hands attested, should be required to be
produced. If married, certificates of the death of the Wife or
Husband, if present these important enquiries are left to the
uncertain provisions of individuals. The declarations above men-
tioned should be accompanied with some details respecting their
birth parentage and last abode, such as may lead to detection.
